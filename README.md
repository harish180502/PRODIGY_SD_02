# PRODIGY_SD_02
Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program
should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high ortoo low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the numberand then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.
